Congratulations on completing your Python final project.  I hope that you got some valuable experience and knowledge from our work together this semester.  Please feel free to reach out to me any time in the future.  You can connect with me on LinkedIn and message me there any time.  I look forward to seeing what the future has in store for you.

Here's feedback on your final project, but if you'd like more detail, please reach out to me.

For future reference, it's nice to use "markdown" cells for comments rather than comments in a Python code cell.  Then you can apply some formating, too!

The list in the cell numbered 12 would have been good to do using a loop rather than copy/paste.

Interesting analysis.  I really enjoyed reading through it and seeing how you worked with the data.  I can imagine there would be a lot of interesting things you could do with this information.  I would have liked to see you stretch that further.

* Data Visualization:      8   -- There were several charts that could have been bigger and formatted differently for more clarity.  I would have also liked to see some more charts to understand the correlation between other variables rather than just how crashes have changed over time.
