Score: 40/50

You were very close on the Framingham.  One point that might have been confusing was the website's explanation of how to calculate the final value.  It was not just "raised to the L" it was "raised to the exponential of the L" meaning `e**L`

You were also headed down a good path on the last problem.  A few things:

1. I wasn't sure why your read in so many things to your `first_format` list.  As the CSV reader reads in each line, it gives you that data just you wrote in lines 44-60.  Why did you then put those back into another list?
