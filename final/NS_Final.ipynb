    "#What does this tool do?\n",
    "#It allows a user to input the the number of fatal crashes and vmt of a roadway or roadway network that is being studied along with the county in which the \n",
    "#study roadway lies. It then takes the inputs, calculates a fatal crash rate per 100000000 VMT, and compares it to fatal crash rates in both the county it lies in\n",
    "#and the overall state rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Why is this useful?\n",
    "#Nearly any traffic study is going to include analysis of the safety conditions of the roadway or roadway network in question. This tool automates some of the\n",
    "#analysis that would be completed in order to evaluate the safety level on the roadway or roadway network. This is effective at giving a high level overview \n",
    "#of the safety conditons of a study roadway.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Where does this fall short?\n",
    "#Ideally, this tool would use data for all crash severities, not just fatal, as that is the more common analysis standard. However, due to limitations with\n",
    "#what was available, fatal crashes were used to prove the concept. \n",
    "\n",
    "#How can this be improved for future use?\n",
    "#Addition all crash severity types, not just fatal, for the reason stated above. The math works exactly the same so it would just be a matter of updating\n",
    "#the data and formatting accordingly. This would open the door to expand the analysis to show the rate of all crashes, injury crash crashes, and fatal \n",
    "#crashes to give a more complete picture.\n",
    "#Another potential use for crash analysis would be mapping of the crash locations. I haven't looked into python's capabilities in this area, but I know\n",
    "#R has some packages that allow you plot geolocated features."
